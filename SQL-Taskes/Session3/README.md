# Session 3 Assignment - DDL Practice + SQL Queries on StoreDB
## Assignment

### Task 1 â€“ Create the DDL (Data Definition Language) for Company ERD#
### Design a full database schema for the following scenario using SQL Server (DDL):

## ðŸ’¡ Notes#
- An employee works for only one department
- A department is managed by one employee
- An employee can work on many projects (M:N)
- Projects must belong to one department
- Employees can have many dependents
- Deleting an employee should delete their dependents automatically
### Constraints:#
Including the following for each table:

- - Required constraints:

- PRIMARY KEY constraints on all tables
- FOREIGN KEY constraints with appropriate ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions
- NOT NULL constraints on required fields
- UNIQUE constraints where applicable
- DEFAULT values for relevant columns
- CHECK constraints for data validation (e.g. gender must be 'M' or 'F')
- Additional requirements:

- - Demonstrate ALTER TABLE usage by:
- Adding a new column
- Adding a FOREIGN KEY constraint
- Modifying a column's data type
- Dropping an existing constraint
- Include sample data insertion
